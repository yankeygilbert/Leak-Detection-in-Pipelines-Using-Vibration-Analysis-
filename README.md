# Leak-Detection-in-Pipelines-Using-Vibration-Analysis-
This is project aimed to achieve leak detection in Pipelines through surface vibration analysis .
 ** All about project (Undergrad  project)
 This project uses cheap accelerometer sensors and microcontrollers to detect leakage in pipelines 
 Through pipes surface vibration analysis.
 The signal processing algorithm utlized here was designed by abhilashpatel121 based on Fourier Transform.
